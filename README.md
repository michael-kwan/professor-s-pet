# Professor's Pet

Professor's Pet is a numerical model that will be able to rank classes within an academic department at UIUC, using [Prof. Fagen-Ulmschneider's dataset](https://github.com/wadefagen/datasets/tree/master/gpa) of grade point averages of offered classes.

Our algorithm is a adaption from the chess ELO rating, as we matched classes between each other as well as students against each other.
